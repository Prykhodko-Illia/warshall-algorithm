Realization of:
1. Graph(v, p) generating as adjacency matrix where: v - vertices count, p - probability for edge to be created.
2. Adjacency matrix to adjacency list converting and vice versa
3. Warshall Algorithm (Finding transitive closure on the matrix) realization
4. Time measurement with your own choise for properties for Warshall Algorithm
